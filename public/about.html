<h1>About Me</h1>
<h4><p>I am graduate from Marmara University, Department of Econometrics. Apart from my participation in classes, 
  I was actively involved in 4 different clubs at school. I took part in the board of directors for a while in the 
  club that I gave the most weight to, we organized activities that required group work. I am open to sports activities 
  and fun-educational cures wholeheartedly. I also worked in various jobs outside of school. As I approached my senior year,
   instead of working in any job, I started to choose choices that are suitable for my branch and that will contribute to me 
   professionally. I attended trainings such as Financial Literacy, Speed Reading and Effective Comprehension and received a 
   certificate. I attended vocational-career-oriented conferences and seminars at my school. Currently, there are e-courses 
   that I am continuing, and I continue to work with course videos such as sign language, HTML-Web Design, E-wieus, R, SQL.

  Management of a monthly average of 1 million TL turnover, employee plans and organization, input-output inventory, 
  turnover development and analysis are among my duties. My store changed in January. In this first quarter, 
  I am 46% ahead of the company target by increasing the turnover by 101.5% to 3.3 million TL. 
  The 29% increase in the number of customers indicates customer satisfaction. Actions taken on electricity consumption
   and personnel expenses resulted in a 2.5% savings compared to the previous year's costs. I always want to contribute to where I am.
